Troop
=====

True JavaScript OOP. Fast & transparent.

Troop provides *base class* and a set of *tools* to build a close approximation of true classes in ECMAScript 5. Troop puts emphasis on:

- instantiation performance at multiple inheritance
- code transparency & reflection: no more duck typing

The price to pay for all this is there are no real privates in Troop. Pseudo-privates are supported, which are accessible from the outside, but not enumerable.
